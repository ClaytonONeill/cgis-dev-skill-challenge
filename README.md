## Pre-deployment notes.

## Before this project goes live, here a few things that could be done:

 - Ensure mobile portability.  While the dev tools do help simulate a mobile environment
   I think that it would be prudent to get some time using this application on a real phone.

 - Lessen the white space next to the user profile in desktop view.  This looks a little odd
   and I think adding come content there would be nice. User resum√© perhaps?

 - Incorporate a 'most viewed' side bar that keeps track of the most popular user profiles.  This
   would involve a bit of reconfiguration and management of state.  I had this idea a little late
   into the project and should have built the environment to handle such additions, but I think this
   would be a cool feature.

 - Adding a 'load more users' button would be another functionality that would be nice.
